====================================
Overview
====================================
You have received the eIDAS Middleware in order to setup the infrastructure to support the German eID card via
your eIDAS connector.

The eIDAS Middleware is distributed in three different ways:

#. Virtual Machine (OVA Format)
#. Docker Image
#. Spring Boot Application
	
You can decide if you want to set up your environment by yourself using just the Spring Boot JAR File
or if you want to use the existing environments of the Virtual Machine or the Docker Image.
The following documentation will provide examples for all three options.

The source code of the eIDAS Middleware is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/governikus/eidas-middleware>`_.

The Docker Images are hosted on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/governikus>`_.

This documentation consists of the following chapters:

* :ref:`introduction` is meant to give you an overview of the German eID system.
* In the chapter :ref:`requirements` you will find some requirements regarding hardware, software and network.
* The chapter :ref:`configuration-mw` will guide you through the first-time configuration of the Middleware.
* The chapter :ref:`operating` will guide you on how to operate the Middleware.
* The :ref:`changelog` lists the changes of the releases and will advise you for possible migration problems.
* At the end you will find the :ref:`glossary`.
