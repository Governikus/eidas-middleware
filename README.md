This repository contains the source code of the German eIDAS middleware.

## Releases
With every release, the source code of our internal repository will be exported into this repository. 
The signed release artifacts will be released on github as well.

## Build
### Building the java sources
We are using maven to build and test the software.

To build the software, execute the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
You can find the compiled JARs in the `target/` directory of each module.

### Building the documentation
The source for the documentation can be found in the `doc` folder.

To build a pdf file, _sphinx_ is needed. Please see the [sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)

To create the pdf file, issue the following commands:

```
cd doc && make clean latexpdf
